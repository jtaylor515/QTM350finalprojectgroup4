Tirso de Molina’s El Burlador de Sevilla tells the story of Don Juan el burlador, who spends his time seducing and cheating many different women without caring about the consequences. Don Juan is a charismatic and entertaining personality, but eventually his misdeeds come back to eventually cause his death in a mysterious act of divine faith. This idea of punishment for sins is an important theme in the story that warns the audience of the consequences of such gallant foolery. His servant, Catalinon, acts as a foil in the story and is always worrying and warning Don Juan of these consequences. He says lots to warn and protest against Don Juan, but he never acts against Don Juan.  Catalinon does not change the course of the story and does not affect the plot through his actions. Instead, he helps to establish the opposing idea to Don Juan’s carefree nature and ignorance of consequences. As an interlocutor and Don Juan’s servant, he is not there to fight Don Juan but instead remind the audience of Don Juan’s character and the potential punishment for his sins. Through his exchanges with Don Juan, we are constantly thinking about these consequences which helps to build and foreshadow the ending of the story. Finally, Catalinon’s survival emphasizes the dangers of careless sinning, and the importance of thinking about consequences.
