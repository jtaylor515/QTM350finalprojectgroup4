A very similar reminder to the audience happens in the next conversation between Don Juan and Marquis de la Mota. While the two are catching up and talking in a friendly matter, Catalinón comments “Como no le entreguéis vos / moza, o cosa que lo valga, / bien podéis fiaros de él, / que, en cuanto en esto es cruel, / tiene condición hidalga”(1287-1291). This is the same type of witty remark, and although it is not said explicitly we can assume that this was directed at the audience because there is no reaction from Mota or Don Juan. Catalinón’s comment works a bit differently this time, because we do not yet know what will happen. It is a comment of foreshadowing for events that follow very soon afterwards, and only a few moments later Mota starts talking about Dona Ana. We are immediately suspicious because Catalinón has reminded us that Don Juan has no honor once a woman is in the situation. Catalinón confirms this as soon as Dona Ana is brought up, saying “No prosigas, que te engaña / el gran burlador de España”(1361-1362). In this way, Catalinón helps pose ideas or questions for the audience that help guide them through the story. His words especially help to keep us thinking about Don Juan’s deceits and the next tricks he will pull off, and later they foreshadow the consequences of these deceits.
