We first see the “aparte” words of Catalinón in the exchange between Octavio and Don Juan, who unbeknownst to Octavio had caused the problems with Isabela. Don Juan is charismatic as usual, and he completely woos Octavio. He offers Octavio his help, saying “Si de mí / algo hubiereis menester, / aquí espada y brazo está”(1268-1269), to which Catalinón responds “(Aparte:)Y si importa, gozará / en su nombre otra mujer / que tiene buena opinión(1270— 1272)”. This is obviously referring to the trick that Octavio does not know of, and the fact that Don Juan is clearly deceiving Octavio with false promises of friendship and help. It is also foreshadowing for Don Juan’s next trick, where he will take the name of Marquis de la Mota (who Don Juan also acts very friendly towards) to seduce Doña Ana. Catalinón says this to the audience only, and more than its comedic value it is also an important reminder to the audience. Don Juan is a very charismatic and entertaining individual and it can be easy to fall under his charm like Octavio does in this moment. We can forget the deception and horrible things he has done in favor of his image as the marvelous “burlador de Sevilla”. Catalinón’s comments help to remind the audience of what Don Juan is actually doing: abusing his status and using his charisma to get the dirty things that he wants. This is important for the audience to remember in order for there to be a moraleja in the story.
