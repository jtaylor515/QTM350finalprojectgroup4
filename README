Welcome to the repository of Group 4 for the QTM350 Final Project! 

We will be investigating how AWS Forecast does in backtesting Economic Stock Data and the records NFL Teams year-by-year.

TODO:
  Data (needs to be csv format and placed in the data branch)
    - Find economic stock price data from 2000-2020 (we will be forecasting the data from 2000-2010 and then comparing against what actually happened)
    - Find NFL Team Record data from as far back as record data was kept (for multiple teams)
    
    - When data has been collected, we can produce analysis in the form of visualization and forecast data
   
  Architecture
    - Create an AWS architecture diagram on draw.io and upload to architecture branch
  
  Blog (needs to be a JupyterLab notebook hosted on AWS)
    - Share blog link under blog branch
    
  ML API
    - Similar to HW3, we need to create a walkthrough on AWS Forecast
