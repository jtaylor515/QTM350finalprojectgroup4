Welcome to the repository of Group 4 for the QTM350 Final Project! 

We will be investigating how AWS Translate compares to the popularly used Google Translate. Our specific comparison will focus English and Spanish.
We will begin with common, simple sentences and progress to sentences deemed "difficult or untranslatable" all the while comparing AWS Translate to Google Translate

TODO:
  Data 
    - Collect a list of common phrases in English
    - Collect a list of complicated phrases in English
    
    - Once translations are run, conduct analysis on differences in results
   
  Architecture
    - Create an AWS architecture diagram on draw.io and upload to architecture branch
  
  Blog (needs to be a JupyterLab notebook hosted on AWS)
    - Share blog link under blog branch
    
  ML API
    - Similar to HW3, we need to create a walkthrough on AWS Translate
