## QTM 350 Final Project (Group 8)
### By Arjun, David, Ryan, Jeffrey, and Jacob

Welcome to the repository of Group 8 for the QTM350 Final Project!

We will be investigating how AWS Translate compares to the popularly used Google Translate. Our specific comparison will focus English and Spanish.
We will begin with common, simple sentences and progress to sentences deemed "difficult or untranslatable" all the while comparing AWS Translate to Google Translate.
We will also work through translating an essay from English to Spanish, and evaluating the translatino capabilities of AWS Translate.
